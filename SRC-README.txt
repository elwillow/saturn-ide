Saturn is written in Lazarus 1.2. To download Lazarus for your OS visit http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/.

Once installed you can either open the file Saturn.lpi with Lazarus and build it (Shift-F9) or go to the command line and run "lazbuild -B --build-mode=final Saturn.lpi" from the source root folder.

PS: You need to know something about modern day Object Pasccal (yes, Pascal :P).
